The officially identified pandemic of COVID-19 is impacting [more than 376 million students worldwide](https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures) (see [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures?fbclid=IwAR34xtgjsaJtaDBgstsWRUHan9RnPJsHWAka_8YCmJ5S51hBy700rDtcQ2M)’s website for updated reports of school closures). The number of students that will experience education disruption grows daily. 

This outbreak comes to the U.S. at the onset of state assessments and spring breaks, which means state departments of education will need to  determine what guidance to offer districts related to state testing and  attendance. 

This article provides an explanation of remote  learning, describes the structured elements necessary for its success,  and includes many resources for schools and higher education  institutions to get started today.

## What Is Remote Learning? 

Remote learning is something a district should be able to switch off and on  based on need; however, the efficiency of transitioning to remote  learning is dependent on preparedness, technology tools, or overall  student support infrastructure. It is different from virtual school or  virtual learning programs that typically have gone through an official  process of establishing a school, adopting an online curriculum, and  creating a dedicated structure to support students enrolled in the  school. eLearning utilizes electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of the traditional classroom. 

Remote learning provides an opportunity for students and teachers to remain connected  and engaged with the content while working from their homes.  Opportunities for remote learning are typically linked to emergency  situations that pose a threat to student safety. 

Transitioning to remote learning can keep students on track so that when they return to  physical school environments, they will not need to complete a lot of  make-up work to be ready for any scheduled assessments. Many of the  requirements in a traditional classroom environment will be in play for  remote learning environments, and the goal is to adhere to as many state and local requirements as possible. 

It is important to note that in remote learning environments, versus virtual learning environments,  the learner and teacher are not accustomed to having distance during  instruction. This may pose a challenge to both teacher and learner that  can be accommodated for through specific support structures.

## The Remote Learning Experience

The structure of remote learning will determine the success students and  teachers will have with the experience. Oftentimes, remote learning is  evoked during a time of stress so it is important not to add more duties to teachers and students. To be most effective with remote learning, a  well-defined structure needs to be in place so it can support a  well-developed instruction plan.

## Structure

The most significant elements of this type of learning include time,  communication, technology, and lesson design. Clearly defining these  elements up front helps to remove distractions from learning.

**TIME
** 
 Time is the first thing schools need to consider because it sets  expectations and boundaries for both students and teachers,  particularly, when to start the school day and how many hours it will  entail. 

First and foremost, teachers should define a set time  period throughout the day when they will be available to students. Make  sure these ‘office hours’ are clearly communicated so students know when the teacher will be available to respond promptly to needs. Sometimes,  teachers will want to connect in real time, or synchronously, with a  student or groups of students. These types of connections can be done  through videoconferencing, through chat, or by phone. Apps such as  FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Skype, Microsoft Teams or Zoom, or What’s  App, can be used to provide these synchronous connections. 

Students should be instructed on how much time they need to spend working on  assignments and other activities outlined in lessons. If there is an  expectation for students to check in regularly, then that needs to be  communicated as well. 

The ‘office hour’ concept can also be used  so that multiple students can communicate in chat sessions  simultaneously, enabling more touch points between the teacher and  students. 

*[*[*Sample eLearning Lesson*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12vVyzSiuVodSuvWqnCQF70ZcqEJ-o398gvUOXcKISUY/edit?usp=sharing)*]*

**COMMUNICATION**

Communication is another aspect that needs to be clearly determined at the onset of  the remote learning experience. Students should know exactly how and  when they are expected to communicate with the teacher. Is email  preferred to an online chat? Should all communication be within the  designated technology tool? What if that tool is not working? What is  the backup plan for communication? Each of these questions should be  answered in an introduction document that sets all of the expectations. 

In addition to how the student should communicate with the teacher,  expectations should also be set for how and how frequently the teacher  will be in touch with the student. For example, it should be made clear  that assignments that would typically have a one- to two-day turnaround  in a traditional classroom will have the same turnaround in a remote  learning environment. 

Teachers should be provided 24 to 72 hours  to complete grading of assignments, depending on length and complexity.  When assignments are returned to students, comments and notes explaining the grading should be included, ideally with more detail than usual  since there may be no immediate opportunity for a student to ask  questions upon receiving the grade. The more feedback that can be  provided during the grading process, the better the student feels about  the work and more confident they feel about continuing with future  assignments. 

**TECHNOLOGY** 

Technology can  vary in impromptu remote learning environments. If schools allow  students to take home devices, then the students should be ready to  learn. Some schools do not have devices to send home, so students must  find ways to access materials provided through technology systems. 

Districts that do not typically engage in remote learning or virtual learning in  their traditional calendars need to provide alternative ways for  students to receive and return assignments. For example, one technology  that has stood the test of time is paper. Sending packets of materials  home with a stamped and addressed return envelope (either addressed to  the school, the teacher or other location), is one way to continue  schooling during a crisis situation. (See more in the Low Tech Solutions section.) 

Schools need to provide very clear information on how  to access any online platform during remote learning, especially if  students, parents and teachers are not accustomed to using such tools on a regular basis. Technical support also needs to be provided throughout the district and not be the responsibility of the teacher, who will  have enough to keep up with in the remote learning environment. Clear  information describing steps for troubleshooting and contact information for additional technical support should be easily available for  everyone. 

**LESSON DESIGN**

Designing lessons  for remote delivery is a little more detailed than creating a lesson  that will be delivered in person simply because in person you can read  the class and determine if students are understanding and then make  adjustments on the fly. In a remote environment, one must assume there  will be a lack of understanding and include extensions and remediations  in the lesson design. 

A typical remote lesson might include the following components: 

- Setting the lesson
   Setting the lesson provides context for the lesson and links it to  previous or future lessons. It helps the learner understand what they  will be doing and why.
- Define Lesson Objectives
   Objectives would be the same in a remote environment as in a  face-to-face environment. But the objectives do need to be written into  the lesson and it is a good practice to **bold the words** that emphasize the action of the learning and the outcome
   **Example**: Capacity to **work theoretically and practically** in the processes of disaster management (disaster risk reduction, response, and recovery) and **relate their interconnections**, particularly in the field of the Public Health aspects of the disasters.
- Assess Current Understanding
   Create a poll or checklist for students to self assess what they know.  This will help them focus on content they aren’t as familiar with as  they move through a lesson.
- Introduce Content
   Example: Watch video on disaster management and read pp. 158 – 213 in  your text. Then log into Google Hangout at noon for teacher presentation of content
- Assign Application Activity
   Example: Create an outline for a disaster management plan that addresses risk reduction, response, and recovery. Follow link to activity rubric
- Assess Mastery
   Example: Complete 5 question quiz on disaster management planning



This lesson design template is a suggestion of how the formatting and flow  of a lesson would work remotely. Teachers have already spent time and  effort preparing their traditional lessons and now must transition them  to a remote experience, but the transition shouldn’t be exacerbating. A  simple presentation template (see [Sample Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12vVyzSiuVodSuvWqnCQF70ZcqEJ-o398gvUOXcKISUY/edit?usp=sharing)) could be provided to faculty to modify their current plans for the remote environment. 

The transition should be made as easy as possible for the teacher and  student. Clearly written Learner Objectives should be provided in  accessible language that is consistent with the text or other materials  being referencing, and should identify an approximate total time on  task. The time it will take for a student to complete a lesson will vary and depend on the grade level, subject matter, and teacher. Lesson time will be modified; for example, a 45-minute traditional lesson may only  be a 20-minute remote learning lesson. 

Activities and assignments should have clear directions and a sample should be provided so that  students know what the finished product should look like. A rubric is  helpful, as are any descriptions/checklists that can be provided related to grading. 

Ending a lesson with reflective questions allows for students to not only reflect on their experience, but also provides  valuable feedback on improving lesson design.
